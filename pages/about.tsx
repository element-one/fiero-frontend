          Harpoon: by Gen Z for Gen Z
        </Text>
        <Text variant='h3' className='mb-2 px-6 md:mb-4 md:px-40'>
          Hey there, we‚Äôre Hugh and Hannah! We started Harpoon because we
          want to reward people for chiming in on the issues, stories, and
          events that matter to our generation. Whether it‚Äôs a video of yourself
          reacting to a news story or a great edit you made that makes people
          laugh, we have the power to bring attention to important issues in a
          better way.

          At the end of the day, we believe what our generation wants is simple:
          equal opportunity to succeed in America, rights over our lives and
          bodies, and affordable access to basic necessities like housing,
          healthcare, and education. Harpoon contests give you the info
          you need to start the conversation, but we want you to bring your own
          perspectives, stories, and opinions to the videos you post.

          We bring the info, you bring the creativity. Every week, we ask our
          members to weigh in on a handful of important conversations. You
          choose the stories and issues that speak to you and turn them into
          TikToks.

          Our members chime in about current events and social issues, but they
          do it in their own voice. From quick and off-the-cuff reactions to
          full edits, we want you to add your point of view to the conversation
          however you‚Äôd like.
